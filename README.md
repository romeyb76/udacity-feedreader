This is a project demonstrating tests being ran in Jasmine.  
Here, I'm running a simuation of an RSS Feed that tests the following: 
1.  RSS Feeds defines the URL and names of the links. 
2.  The menu toggles on and off. 
3.  Initial Entries are completed. 
4.  Content changes when a new feed is entered. 

This tests utilizes the programming languages HTML, CSS and JavaScript, and testing is via the Jasmine platform.
